Command line tools
==================

Since GLPI 9.2.2, command line tools are provided as supported scripts and are available from the ``scripts`` directory of the archive. On previous versions, those scripts were present in the ``tools`` directory that is not official and therefore not in the release archive.

Since GLPI 9.4.0, command line tools are being centralized in a console application (``bin/console``).
Calling ``php bin/console`` from GLPI directory displays the list of available commands.

.. note::

   If APCu is installed on your system, it may fail from command line since default configuration disables it from command-line. To change that, set ``apc.enable_cli`` to ``on`` in your APCu configuration file.

.. _cdline_options:

Console options
---------------

For every console command, following options are available:

 * ``--config-dir=CONFIG-DIR`` path of configuration directory to use, relative to current working directory (required only if a custom path is used)
 * ``-h``, ``--help`` displays command help
 * ``--lang=LANG`` output language code (default value is existing GLPI "language" configuration or "en_GB")
 * ``-n``, ``--no-interaction`` disable command interactive questions
 * ``--no-plugins`` disable GLPI plugins during command execution
 * ``-q``, ``--quiet`` disable command output
 * ``-v|vv|vvv``, ``--verbose=VERBOSE`` verbosity level: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

.. _cdline_install:

Install
-------

The ``php bin/console db:install`` has been made to install GLPI database in CLI mode.

Possible options for this command are:

 * ``-H``, ``--db-host`` host name (`localhost` per default)
 * ``-P``, ``--db-port`` database port (default MySQL port if option is not defined)
 * ``-d``, ``--db-name`` database name
 * ``-u``, ``--db-user`` database user name
 * ``-p``, ``--db-password`` database user's pasword
 * ``-L``, ``--default-language`` default language of GLPI (`en_GB` per default)
 * ``-f``, ``--force`` do not check if GLPI is already installed and drop what would exists

If mandatory options are not specified in the command call, the console will ask for them.

See also :ref:`console options <cdline_options>`.

.. _cdline_update:

Update
------

The ``php bin/console db:update`` has been made to update GLPI database in CLI mode from a previously installed version.

There is no required arguments, just run the command so it updates your database automatically.

.. warning::

   Do not forget to backup your database before any update try!

Possible options for this command are:

 * ``-u``, ``--allow-unstable`` allow update to an unstable version (use it with cautions)
 * ``-f``, ``--force`` force execution of update from v-1 version of GLPI even if schema did not changed

See also :ref:`console options <cdline_options>`.

Database tools
--------------

Database schema check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``php bin/console db:check`` command can be used to check if your database schema differs from expected one.

If you have any diff, output will looks like :

.. code-block:: none

    $ php bin/console glpi:database:check
    Table schema differs for table "glpi_rulecriterias".
    --- Original
    +++ New
    @@ @@
     create table `glpi_rulecriterias` (
       `id` int(11) not null auto_increment
       `rules_id` int(11) not null default '0'
       `criteria` varchar(255) default null
       `condition` int(11) not null default '0'
    -  `pattern` text default null
    +  `pattern` text
       primary key (`id`)

Tasks tools
-----------

Task unlock
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``php bin/console task:unlock`` command can be used to unlock stucked cron tasks.

.. warning::

   Keep in mind that no task should be stucked except in case of a bug or a system failure (database failure during cron execution for example).

Possible options for this command are:

 * ``-a``, ``--all`` unlock all tasks
 * ``-c``, ``--cycle[=CYCLE]`` execution time (in cycles) from which the task is considered as stuck (delay = task frequency * cycle)
 * ``-d``, ``--delay[=DELAY]`` execution time (in seconds) from which the task is considered as stuck (default: 1800)
 * ``-t``, ``--task[=TASK]`` ``itemtype::name`` of task to unlock (e.g: ``MailCollector::mailgate``)

See also :ref:`console options <cdline_options>`.

Migration tools
---------------

From MyISAM to InnoDB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. versionadded:: 9.3.0

Since version 9.3.0, GLPI uses the ``InnoDB`` engine instead of previously used ``MyISAM`` engine.

The ``php bin/console glpi:migration:myisam_to_innodb`` command can be used to migrate exiting tables to ``InnoDB`` engine.

Missing timestamps builder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. versionadded:: 9.1.0

Prior to GLPI 9.1.0, fields corresponding to creation and modification dates were not existing.

The ``php bin/console glpi:migration:build_missing_timestamps`` command can be used to rebuild missing values using available logs.
